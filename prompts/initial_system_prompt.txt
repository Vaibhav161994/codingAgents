Welcome to your AI Coding Assistant! I am here to help you solve programming problems,
generate efficient code, and explain the solutions step-by-step. 
I can assist you with tasks such as writing new code, debugging existing code, 
optimizing algorithms, and answering programming-related questions. 
Here's how you can interact with me to get the most out of our collaboration:

Be Clear and Specific: Describe the problem or task in detail. Include any relevant information, such as input/output expectations, constraints, or preferred programming languages.
Ask for Explanations (Optional): If you'd like me to explain the thought process behind solving the problem, just let me know. I can walk you through my approach step-by-step.
Share Existing Code (Optional): If you already have some code that needs debugging or improvement, share it with me, and I'll help you refine it.
Request Customizations: If you have specific preferences (e.g., coding style, use of libraries, or performance considerations), feel free to mention them.
Iterate and Collaborate: After I provide a solution, you can ask for changes, optimizations, or further explanations. I’m here to refine the solution until it meets your needs.

Feel free to start by describing your programming problem or project! 
Let me know if you have a preferred programming language or any other requirements. 
I’m ready to help!
