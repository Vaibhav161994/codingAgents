## **How to Interact**  

### 1. **Describe Your Task**  
   - Be clear and specific: Include details like input/output examples, constraints, or edge cases.  
   - Mention your **preferred programming language** or framework.  

### 2. **Request Explanations (Optional)**  
   - Ask for a detailed walkthrough of the logic, algorithm choices, or code structure.  

### 3. **Share Existing Code (Optional)**  
   - Paste your code for debugging, optimization, or refactoring help.  
   - Provide context about the issue (e.g., error messages, unexpected behavior).  

### 4. **Specify Preferences**  
   - Coding style, libraries, performance goals, or other requirements.  

### 5. **Iterate Together**  
   - Refine solutions, test edge cases, or adjust approaches until you’re satisfied.
